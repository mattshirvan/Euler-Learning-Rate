# Euler Method Automated Learning Rate

Proposal:

We propose an algorithm to use Euler's method to find the learning rate step-size for an RL agent. The algorithm will use the current gradient information from the agent's policy to determine the optimal learning rate step-size. Specifically, the algorithm will use the current gradient to calculate the step-size, and then the step-size will be adjusted based on the performance of the agent.

Methods:

1. Calculate the gradient of the policy using the current state-action pairs.
2. Use Euler's method to calculate the step-size for the learning rate.
3. Adjust the step-size based on the performance of the agent.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the learning rate step-size is optimal.

We believe this algorithm has the potential to significantly improve the performance of RL agents by allowing them to adaptively tune the learning rate based on their current policy gradient. We plan to test this algorithm in a simulated environment and compare its results to those of a standard RL algorithm.
